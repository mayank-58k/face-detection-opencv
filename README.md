# Face Detection Video using OpenCV

This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect human faces from your webcam in real-time using Haar Cascade classifiers.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade model
- Displays video in grayscale with detected faces outlined

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the code.
2. Make sure OpenCV is installed:  
   `pip install opencv-python`
3. Run the script:  
   `python face_detection_video.py`

## Output
Detected faces will be highlighted with a blue rectangle in a grayscale video stream.
